# Felis-Catus-Game

This game has been made and thought about for fucking AGES! It's been redone loads of times and it's a bit shite. 
Hopefully we'll be able to turn that around! It's going to be open source anyway because that's awesome. 

@crabcrabcam - Main dev

@nerd6981 - Alt dev that does nothing however probably won't notice this

And the other guys who don't help anymore and don't have git accounts that probably made most of the art...
